Here is the revised content for the `../blinky/README.md` file, providing an overview and setup instructions for the blinky project:

# Blinky Project

This project implements a simple blinking LED design on the Cmod A7 35T FPGA using Vitis 2024.2. The design is captured in Verilog and is constrained using an XDC file for proper pin assignments.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Ensure you have Vitis 2024.2 and Vivado installed on your system.
   - Connect your Cmod A7 35T FPGA to your computer via USB.

2. **Create a New Project in Vivado**
   - Open Vivado and create a new project.
   - Choose "RTL Project" and do not specify sources at this point.
   - Set the project location to your `blinky` directory.
   - Select the Cmod A7 35T board or the specific part number (xc7a35tcpg236-1).

3. **Add Source Files**
   - Add `blinky.v` as your design source.
   - Add `constraints.xdc` as your constraints file.

4. **Synthesize, Implement, and Generate Bitstream**
   - Click on "Run Synthesis" and wait for it to complete.
   - After synthesis, click on "Run Implementation."
   - Once implementation is complete, generate the bitstream.

5. **Export Hardware to Vitis**
   - After generating the bitstream, open the hardware manager to program the device.
   - Export the hardware with the bitstream included to a location of your choice.

6. **Create a New Application Project in Vitis**
   - Open Vitis and create a new application project.
   - Select the hardware platform exported from Vivado.
   - Choose a standalone domain.

7. **Program the FPGA**
   - Connect to the target FPGA in Vitis.
   - Program the FPGA with the generated bitstream.

8. **Verify the Blinky Program**
   - Once programmed, observe that the LED on the Cmod A7 35T board is blinking, indicating the program is running correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully implement and run the blinky project on your FPGA.
